### Pro Users

Pro subscribers receive a one-time $10 API credit when upgrading to Pro. Use it to test and build small apps. You can scale your usage by buying credits, buying Diem, or staking.

### Paid Tier

Choose how you pay for API usage:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Buy API Credits">
    Pay in USD via the [API Dashboard](https://venice.ai/settings/api). Credits are applied to usage automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Buy Diem (1 Diem = $1/day)">
    Purchase Diem directly. Each Diem grants $1 of compute per day at the same rates as USD.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stake to Earn Diem (1 Diem = $1/day)">
    Stake tokens to receive daily Diem allocations (each Diem grants $1 of compute per day). Manage staking and Diem at the [Token Dashboard](https://venice.ai/token).
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Model Pricing

All prices are in USD. Diem users pay the same rates (1 Diem = $1 of compute per day).

### Chat Models

Prices per 1M tokens, with separate pricing for input and output tokens. You will only be charged for the tokens you use.
You can estimate the token count of a chat request using [this calculator](https://quizgecko.com/tools/token-counter).
