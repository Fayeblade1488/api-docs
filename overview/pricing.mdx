### Pro Users

Pro subscribers automatically receive a one-time $10 API credit upon upgrading to Pro â€“ double the credit amount compared to competitors. This credit provides capacity for testing and small applications, with seamless pathways to scale via VVV staking or direct USD payments for larger implementations.

### Paid Tier

Paid access to the Venice API can be obtained in two ways:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Purchased API Credits">
    Users can purchase API credits via the [API Dashboard](https://venice.ai/settings/api).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stake VVV">
    Users can [stake VVV](https://venice.ai/blog/how-to-stake-and-claim-your-venice-tokens-vvv) which in return, provides you proportional access to
    Venice's compute pool in units called Diem. A Diem is worth $1 of API credit per day. The more you stake, the higher your Diem allocation, and they renew daily. You also earn staking rewards while staked. Visit the [Token Dashboard](https://venice.ai/token) to stake VVV and to see how much Diem you control.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Model Pricing

All prices are in USD. Diem users pay the same rates (1 Diem = $1).

### Chat Models

Prices per 1M tokens, with separate pricing for input and output tokens. You will only be charged for the tokens you use.
You can estimate the token count of a chat request using [this calculator](https://quizgecko.com/tools/token-counter).
