<Update label="February, 2025">
  ## Inpainting Support in API
  - Inpainting support has been added to the API in beta form.
  - The API supports using Venice.ai's LLM to calculate the inpainting mask via the prompt parameter, and specificifying a specific mask via the mask object.
  - Examples can be found here on [Postman](https://www.postman.com/veniceai/workspace/venice-ai-workspace/folder/38652128-d1e45aef-ef5b-4219-8500-9049e890d8e0?action=share&creator=38652128&ctx=documentation&active-environment=38652128-ef110f4e-d3e1-43b5-8029-4d6877e62041).

  ## Character Support in API

  The chat inference API has been extended to support interacting with Venice Public Characters. Appending the following to the inference paramters will load the character into the context of the inference request:

  ```
    "venice_parameters": {
        "character_slug": "alan-watts"
    }
  ```

  The character slug can be found on the character page listed as the Public ID.

  ## Bug Fixes / Minor Revisions
  - The `/api/v1/models` endpoint will now return only text models by default. The `type` query parameter has been extended to support `all | image | text` and the `type` parameter has been added to the body to indicate what filter was used.
  - The model list endpoint now includes a `modelSource` parameter:
```
{
            "id": "llama-3.3-70b",
            "model_spec": {
                "modelSource": "https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct",
                ...
            },
            ...
        }
```
  - Support Deepseek 671 and Qwen Coder 2.5's full 128k context on requests made via the API.
  - Increased limit on image prompt length in API from 1500 to 2048 characters for all models except SD3.5.
  - Ensure mis-formatted requests that include an empty `tools_calls: []` parameter on a message do not return return HTTP 500 errors. This fixes an error reported in [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1318981892061794375/1319699997108736084/1336161677040812135).
  - Fixed issue where the use of max_completion_tokens in combination with the llama-3.1-405b model would result in a 500 response.

<Update label="January, 2025">
  ## Image Prompt limit increased

  The prompt limit on image generation has been increased to 1,500 characters on supported models (e.g. Flux and SDXL based models).

  ## Image Generation: Safe Mode

  Image generation now supports the filtering of adult content by passing in the `safe_mode` paramter as `true`. Safe mode will screen for adult content, and if detected, will blur the image and set the `x-venice-is-blurred` header to true. The [docs](/api-reference/endpoint/image/generate) have been updated and an example Postman request can be found [here](https://www.postman.com/veniceai/workspace/venice-ai-workspace/request/38652128-5372f5a4-eb5f-4dcf-9c2f-3c24e01ec3b2?action=share\&source=copy-link\&creator=38652128\&active-environment=ef110f4e-d3e1-43b5-8029-4d6877e62041).

  ## Image Generation: Stable Diffusion 3.5 Support

  Stable Diffusion is now supported in the image generation endpoint.

  ## Image Styles API

  An API endpoint has been updated to list currently supported API styles. PLease see [the docs here](/api-reference/endpoint/image/styles).
</Update>

<Update label="December, 2024">
  ## Function Calling Support

  Function calling support has been introduced using the Llama 3.3 70B model. Use the `function_calling_default` model trait. See an example request within [Postman here](https://www.postman.com/veniceai/workspace/venice-ai-workspace/request/38652128-fe6332a4-7e7c-42e6-aa64-825c14f06876?action=share\&source=copy-link\&creator=38652128\&active-environment=ef110f4e-d3e1-43b5-8029-4d6877e62041).

  ## Pony Realism activate in image generation API

  The `pony-realism` model has been activated within the image generation API. It is now tagged with the `most_uncensored` trait.

  ## Model Filtering

  The `/api/v1/models` endpoint has been updated to support filtering by a `type` parameter. Check out the update [here](https://docs.venice.ai/api-reference/endpoint/models/list).
