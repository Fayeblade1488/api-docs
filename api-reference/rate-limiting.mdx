title: Rate Limits
---

Venice rate limits API requests to 20 per minute per user, regardless of how many keys are created.&#x20;

<Note>**Please note**: This will evolve to change as the beta evolves.</Note>

You can monitor your API utilization and remaining requests by evaluating the following headers:

| **x-ratelimit-limit-requests**     | The number of requests you've made in the current evaluation period.  |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **x-ratelimit-remaining-requests** | The remaining requests you can make in the current evaluation period. |
| **x-ratelimit-reset-requests**     | The duration of time until your rate limit resets.                    |
