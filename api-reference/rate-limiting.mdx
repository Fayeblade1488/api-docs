title: Rate Limits
---

Venice has two tiers of utilizaiton:
- **Explorer** - This is a trial tier designed to allow testing the Venice AI. It is included for PRO users and users staking VVV who haven't yet had VCU allocated.
- **Paid** - This is a paid tier. Users will be debited VCU first, and when VCU is depleted, will be debited USD. If no balance of either VCU or USD is available, requests will fail.

## Explorer Tier Rate Limits
Venice rate limits API requests to 20 per minute per user, regardless of how many keys are created.&#x20;

<Note>**Please note**: This will evolve to change as the beta evolves.</Note>

You can monitor your API utilization and remaining requests by evaluating the following headers:

| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **x-ratelimit-limit-requests**     | The number of requests you've made in the current evaluation period.  |
| **x-ratelimit-remaining-requests** | The remaining requests you can make in the current evaluation period. |
| **x-ratelimit-reset-requests**     | The unix time stamp when the rate limit will reset                    |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Paid Tier Rate Limits
We will post more information on paid tier rate limits soon.
