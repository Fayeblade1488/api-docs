Venice supports additional capabilities within it's models that can be powered by the `venice_parameters` input on the chat completions endpoint.

In certain circumstances, you may be using a client that does not let you modify the request body. For those platforms, you can utilize Venice's Model Feature Suffix offering to pass flags in via the model ID.

### Instructions

You can append any valid `venice_parameter` value to the end of the model ID as follows. These feature suffix should follow the model name with a `:` and you can chain multiple features together:

**To Set Web Search to Auto**
```
default:enable_web_search=auto
```

**To Enable Web Search and Disable System Prompt**
```
default:enable_web_search=true&include_venice_system_prompt=false
```

**To Use a Character**
```
default:character_slug=alan-watts
```
