### Free Tier

Venice is pleased to offer Beta API access to our Pro users free of charge, initially, as we strive to gain a deeper understanding of the usage demands and requirements of our community. Call limits are relatively low, but it's free.&#x20;

### Stake Tier

If you [stake VVV](https://venice.ai/blog/how-to-stake-and-claim-your-venice-tokens-vvv) you are entitled to a certain amount of inference on a daily basis (unified into one metric as Venice Compute Units or "VCU"). The more you stake, the higher your limits, and they renew daily. You also earn staking rewards while staked. Visit the [Token Dashboard](https://venice.ai/token) to stake VVV and to see how much VCU you control.&#x20;

See the section below for our preliminary VCU pricing. As our offering matures we will be releasing more details on different types of pricing and tiers.

## Preliminary VCU Pricing

### Chat Models

Chat models are priced per million tokens, with separate pricing for input and output tokens. While the price is per million tokens, you will only be charged for the tokens you use. You can estimate the token count of a chat request using [this calculator](https://quizgecko.com/tools/token-counter).

| Model            | Input Tokens (million) | Output Tokens (million) |

### Image models

Image models are priced per image. For the moment there is no
per-model image pricing. This will change in a future price update.

| Image Model | One 1024x1024 Image\* |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| All\*       | 0.1 VCU               |

\**High resolution images are metered as 2 images.*
