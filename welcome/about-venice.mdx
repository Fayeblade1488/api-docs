## Accessing the API

Venice users can access the API in 3 ways:

1. Pro Account: Users with a PRO account will gain access to the Venice API within the “Explorer Tier”. This tier has lower rate-limits, and is intended for simple interaction with the API.

2. VCUs: With Venice’s [launch of the VVV token](https://venice.ai/blog/introducing-the-venice-token-vvv), users who stake tokens within the Venice protocol gain access to a daily AI inference allocation (as well as ongoing staking yield). When staking, users receive VCUs, which represent a portion of the overall Venice compute capacity. You can stake VVV tokens and [see your VCU allotment here](https://venice.ai/token). Users with positive VCU balance are entitled to “Paid Tier” rate limits.

3. USD: Users can also opt to deposit USD into their account to pay for API inference the same way that they would on other platforms, like OpenAI or Anthropic. Users with positive USD balance are entitled to “Paid Tier” rate limits.
