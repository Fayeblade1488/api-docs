Venice's API utilizes API keys for user authentication. Once you have either Staked VVV token, or funded your account with USD, you can create an API key to begin using the API.&#x20;

To get to the API settings page, you can go to [https://venice.ai/token](https://venice.ai/token), and click "API" on the lefthand toolbar. You can also access this page by clicking "API" within your user settings.&#x20;

Either method will bring you to your API Dashboard (https://venice.ai/settings/api), where you can view your VCU and USD balance, API Tier, API Usage, and API Keys

You will have a few options during your API key setup

* Description: This is used to name your API key

* API Key Type: "Admin" keys have the ability to delete or generate additional API keys programmatically. "Inference Only" keys have more limited user access.&#x20;

* Expires at: You can choose to set an expiration date for the API key. By default, a date will not be set, and the key will not expire automatically.&#x20;

* Epoch Consumption Limits: This allows you to create limits for API usage from the individual API key. You can choose to limit the VCUs or USD amount allowable within a given Epoch (24hrs)

Once the settings are configured, click "Generate" to create your API key. Please note that you must copy the API key at this time, you will not be able to see the full key once the window is closed.&#x20;
