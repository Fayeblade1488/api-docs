description: How to use the Venice API in a NextJS application
---

We've created a simple example of how to use the Venice API in a NextJS application.

This example includes:

* Using chat completions with OpenAI spec

* Getting the list of supported models via the venice api

All the integrations with the endpoints will be located at `app/actions/...`
